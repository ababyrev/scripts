1. RRRR - Bloomberg function that can be used to run another Bloomber function from any machine (if that function exists)  i.e RRRR NH P060.
2. act.log - A log file that aggregates logs from all tasks running on the machine.
3. spew.log - a log file used to store excessively repetitive messages that may otherwise pollute act.log with identical messages.
4. /bb/bin/ - directory where executables live. - .tsk files.
5. /bb/data/ - stores important data files.
6. 'console' task - writes logs to act.log and tracks the frequency of identical messages.
7. "SPEW" - a keyword that can appear in a act.log messages when message is being duplicated multiple times in act.log
8. "SPEWER" - keyword that displays in act.log messages before those messages are redirected to /bb/data/spew.log
9. openpipe - wrapper script that creates an empty 'pipe' file with .fifo extension in /tmp/ directory.
10. why do we need .fifo 'pipe' files? - applications write log messages to their .fifo files and those messages appear in act.log via 'console' task.
11. conwatch - wrapper script that prints act.log to the screen.
12. bbgtail - tails act.log
13. conoff - stops conwatch from printing to screen.
14. procmngr - runs on USER machines and listens to /tmp/p/fifo for commands to run.
15. .trap - files that get created when a process starts, they are used to verify that application started successfully.
16. pstart - starts a task and tells procmngr to restart that task if it stops.
17. bbmktmp - used with send taskname exit to gracefully bring down a task like a database to prevent database corruption.
18.There are 3 types of Bloomberg environments: DBINI - full environment. Mini and Nano that run lighter versions of Bloomberg environment.

20. Pause, Continue - use to pause and continue executing any Unix process.
???21. diskspace
???22.disksort
23./bb/data/tmp/ - used by DB to rebuild large files.
24. /bb/bigmem - used by BIGs machines to cache data.
25. staf - wrapper script that determines if process is temporary or permanent.
